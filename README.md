# c-workshop

Relearning C for the n-th time with simple programs, with corresponding Makefile.

Compilers, free, used:

* gcc (tdm64-1) 4.9.2
* Borland C 5.5, as it looks it's still a think for learing
* Turbo C++ 1.0

Available samples:

* hiWorld a must have... Make file for Borland 5.5 and GCC/MinGW64
* arguments to explore command line arguments
* fileExists... Because we always want to know if a file does or doesn't exist
* externalLib simple use case of a custom exterenal library
